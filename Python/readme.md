# Scripts in Python

- Computer programming isn't just used for math. You can teach a computer [english grammar](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/english_grammar.py)!
- If your head is in the clouds, good! You can use programming to [explore the planets](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/astronomy.py)!
- Don't you just love math, expecially when the computer does it for you? You can do [basic math](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/math_basic.py) in python
- You can also do math using OOP(**Object-Oriented-Programming**). Check [it](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/math_OOP.py) out.
- [Demography](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/demography.py) is the study of human population. Check out how to explore this using OOP in Python.
- Interested in how organisms are related? Then explore and expand upon this [Ecology](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/ecology.py) script.
- When making 3d video games, vector math is very helpful. Simulate the [dot and cross product](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/dotAndCross.py) with Python!
- Put notebooks/files into a zipped backpack/zip archive with this [schoobag script](https://github.com/TutorialDoctor/Scripts-for-Kids/blob/master/Python/schoolbag.py).
